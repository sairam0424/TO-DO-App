Key Components
App.js

-The root component that integrates all child components and connects them to the Redux store.
components/

-FilterButtons.js: Provides buttons for filtering tasks by status (e.g., all, active, completed).
-Todo.js: The main component for the Todo feature, responsible for rendering the overall layout.
-TodoItem.js: Represents a single task in the todo list with options to mark as completed, edit, or delete.
-TodoList.js: Handles displaying a list of tasks. It retrieves the todos from Redux state and maps them to TodoItem components.
redux/

-store.js: Configures and initializes the Redux store, combining reducers if necessary.
-todoactions.js: Contains action creators that return action objects to be dispatched (e.g., addTodo, deleteTodo).
-todoActionTypes.js: Defines all action type constants to avoid typos and duplication (e.g., ADD_TODO, DELETE_TODO).
-todoreducer.js: The reducer function that updates the Redux state based on the dispatched actions. It handles actions like adding, editing, and deleting todos.
3. State Management with Redux
todoreducer.js
State Structure:

-javascript
Copy code
{
  todos: [
    {
      id: '1',
      text: 'Learn Redux',
      completed: false,
    },
    // ... more todos
  ],
  filter: 'all', // can be 'all', 'active', 'completed'
}
--Reducers:

-ADD_TODO: Adds a new todo item to the list.
-DELETE_TODO: Removes a todo item from the list.
-TOGGLE_TODO: Toggles the completed status of a todo item.
-SET_FILTER: Sets the current filter for displaying todos.
Actions in todoactions.js:

-addTodo(text): Action to add a new todo.
-deleteTodo(id): Action to delete a specific todo.
-toggleTodo(id): Action to toggle the completion status of a todo.
-setFilter(filter): Action to set the current filter.
4. UI Flow
Main Flow:
Users add, view, and interact with tasks using components in the components/ directory.
Actions dispatched from these components trigger state updates managed by the Redux store via todoreducer.js.
The UI is re-rendered based on the updated state, reflecting changes such as new tasks or filtered views.

## Features

CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new todos with a title and description.
Read: View a list of todos with their current status.
Update: Edit the title, description, and priority of existing todos.
Delete: Remove todos from the list.
Completion Filters:

Filter todos based on their completion status (Completed or Incomplete).
Search Functionality:

Search todos by title or description to quickly find specific tasks.
Animations:

Tailwind CSS for responsive and visually appealing design.

## State Management
The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management. The applicationâ€™s state includes:

todos: An array of task objects, each containing details like id, text, completed, priority, and dueDate.
Redux actions and reducers manage the state, ensuring that tasks are added, updated, deleted, and persisted effectively.
